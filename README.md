# Image-Color-Classifier-DL-project


I recently completed a project where I built a Deep Learning Color Classifier. Here’s a brief overview:

🔍 Imported essential libraries, including TensorFlow.
🧹 Preprocessed and cleaned the data for optimal model performance.
📊 Identified and visualized data correlations using heatmaps.
🧠 Trained and evaluated a neural network model with TensorFlow.
📈 Visualized accuracy and loss metrics using Matplotlib.
